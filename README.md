# Smart Cart Control
This code is for driving a heavy-load cart in a smart manner with fine speed control, a dead-man switch, and a ramp up / ramp down function

## Hardware
Current: (will change)
- Arduino Pro Mini
- Talon SRX
- 10k logarithmic potentiometer
- Single-Pole Triple-Throw momentary rocker switch

Will be adding quad-digit 7-segment display for showing speed percentage, also will comment code better!
